[AngularJS and Ionic fontend of the application](https://github.com/ith-harvey/destination-travel)

Sifting through massive amounts of information online has always been a difficult process for travelers. Although recommendation sites have become the norm, word of mouth continues to prevail as the go to resource for every traveler.

This application, Destination, on top of providing an individual user a way to organize and document their own travels, acts as an extension of word of mouth. This allows users to access the cities that their facebook friends have traveled to and export all of the hotels, restaurants and destinations that their friends have marked.
